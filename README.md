# Simucrypto

Simucrypto is a browser-based simulation game designed to educate users about cryptocurrency trading, banking, and social media dynamics within a fictional ecosystem. The project is built primarily with JavaScript and provides an interactive experience mimicking real-world crypto platforms.

## Features

### 1. Banking System
- **Signup & Account Creation:** Users can sign up, creating a fictional bank account with a starting balance.
- **Deposit & Withdrawal:** Manage funds by depositing to or withdrawing from your bank account.
- **Transaction History:** Track your banking activity with a detailed transaction log.
- **Money Transfer:** Send money to the in-game exchange ("CoinFlip Exchange") and receive funds back to your bank ("Bankerz").

### 2. Crypto Exchange
- **Trade Fictional Coins:** Buy and sell three main coins: NeuraX (NRX), Solvex (SVX), and CoreChain (CRC), each with its own price dynamics.
- **Simulated Price Fluctuations:** Coin prices change randomly, allowing users to strategize buying and selling.
- **Exchange Balance:** Funds sent from your bank can be used to purchase coins; selling coins increases your exchange balance.
- **Historical Charts:** View historical price charts for all coins, powered by Chart.js.

### 3. Social Media Simulation ("Cryptochat")
- **NPC & User Posts:** Interact with mock social media posts from NPCs (influencers and civilians) and contribute your own.
- **Market Sentiment:** Posts reflect market sentiment, rumors, and use cases for each coin, affecting the simulation's atmosphere.

### 4. Crypto News ("BlockBuzz")
- **Simulated Headlines & Rumors:** Read fictional news headlines and market rumors that can influence prices and gameplay strategy.

### 5. Whitepapers Library
